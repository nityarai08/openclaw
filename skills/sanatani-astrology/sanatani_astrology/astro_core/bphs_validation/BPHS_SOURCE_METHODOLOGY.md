and a commanding presence, as described in BPHS Ch. 11, verse 11.1. This
creates natural authority and recognition from others."
```

#### 2. Modern Contextual Adaptation

**Guidelines:**

- Translate ancient concepts to contemporary situations
- Maintain astrological accuracy while improving accessibility
- Provide practical applications for modern life
- Bridge traditional wisdom with current understanding

**Example:**

```
Classical Context: "Success with the king and royal court"
Modern Adaptation: "Recognition from government officials, corporate executives,
or authority figures in your field"

Classical Context: "Wealth from cattle and agriculture"
Modern Adaptation: "Success in agriculture, livestock, food industry, or
natural resource businesses"
```

#### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
